# 🎯 Google Food-101 Setup Status

## ✅ **Configuration Complete!**

Your MacroTrackr app is now configured to use **Google Food-101** as the highest priority model for food recognition.

## 🔄 **Updated Model Priority Order**

Your app will now check for models in this exact order:

1. **🥇 `GoogleFood101.mlmodel`** - Your custom-trained Google Food-101 (when ready)
2. **🥈 `Food101.mlmodel`** - Pre-trained Food-101 backup
3. **🥉 `ResNet50.mlmodel`** - High-accuracy general classification  
4. **🏅 `MobileNetV2.mlmodel`** - Fast lightweight option
5. **🔄 Vision Framework** - Built-in Apple fallback

## 🚀 **What's Ready Right Now**

✅ **Model loading code** updated to prioritize `GoogleFood101`  
✅ **Food-101 class name processing** (converts `apple_pie` → `Apple Pie`)  
✅ **Nutrition estimation** ready for 101 food categories  
✅ **Complete training guide** in `GOOGLE_FOOD101_TRAINING_GUIDE.md`  
✅ **Automatic fallback** to other models if GoogleFood101 not found  

## 📋 **When You're Ready to Train**

1. **Follow** `GOOGLE_FOOD101_TRAINING_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions
2. **Download** Google Food-101 dataset (6GB, ~15-30 minutes)
3. **Train** with Create ML (2-4 hours on your M1 Mac)
4. **Export** as `GoogleFood101.mlmodel`
5. **Add** to this Models folder
6. **Build & test** - your app will automatically use it!

## 🎉 **Current Status**

**Ready for training when you are!** The app will work perfectly with existing models until then, and automatically switch to your custom Google Food-101 model once it's trained and added.
