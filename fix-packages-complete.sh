echo "   - Product Name: MacroTrackr"
echo "   - Interface: SwiftUI"
echo "   - Language: Swift"
echo "   - Use Core Data: NO"

echo "2. Add Swift Package Dependencies:"
echo "   - File â†’ Add Package Dependencies"
echo "   - Add these URLs one by one:"
echo "     â€¢ https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift"
echo "     â€¢ https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher"
echo "     â€¢ https://github.com/realm/realm-swift"
echo ""
echo "3. Copy your source files:"
echo "   - Copy MacroTrackrApp.swift from this project"
echo "   - Copy all other .swift files from the MacroTrackr folder"
echo "   - Copy Info.plist settings"
echo ""
echo "4. Configure capabilities:"
echo "   - Add Camera, Photo Library, Push Notifications"
echo "   - Add Sign in with Apple if needed"
echo ""
echo "This will give you a clean, working project with all dependencies! ðŸš€"

echo "Alternative: Try opening the current project and:"
echo "1. File â†’ Packages â†’ Reset Package Caches"
echo "2. File â†’ Packages â†’ Resolve Package Versions"
echo "3. If that fails, remove and re-add all packages manually"
