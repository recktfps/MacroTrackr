## 🗄️ Database Configuration

### Required Supabase Setup:
1. **Tables:** profiles, meals, friend_requests, friendships, saved_meals, shared_meals
2. **Storage Buckets:** 
   - `meal-images` (public, for meal photos)
   - `profile-images` (public, for profile pictures)
3. **Triggers:** `handle_accepted_friend_request` (auto-creates friendships)
4. **RLS Policies:** Configured for all tables and storage buckets

### Verify Database:
```sql
-- Check if profile-images bucket exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'profile-images';

-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE trigger_name = 'handle_accepted_friend_request_trigger';
```
