**All Requested Features:** ✅ COMPLETED

## 🎉 Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Separate Daily Meals from Saved Presets

**What Changed:**
- Added "Save as Preset" toggle in AddMealView
- Daily meals ALWAYS log to your daily intake
- Saved presets ONLY created when toggle is ON
- Search shows only saved presets, not every daily meal

**How It Works:**
```
Add Meal → Always logs to today
         → Toggle ON = Also saves as reusable preset
         → Toggle OFF = Just today's log (no preset saved)
```

**Benefits:**
- No clutter in search results
- Intentional preset library
- Daily tracking separate from meal library

### 2. ✅ Email Privacy - Hidden Everywhere

**What Changed:**
- Email addresses completely hidden from UI
- Profile shows: Display name + @username
- Friends list: Shows "Friend" instead of email
- User search: No longer searches by email
- Only display names visible

**Locations Updated:**
- ProfileView: Own profile (line 218)
- UserRowView: When viewing other users (line 869)
- FriendsListView: Friends display (line 952)
- UsersListView: Search filter (line 805)

**Result:** Complete email privacy ✅
