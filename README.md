## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+ target device or simulator
- Supabase account (free plan works great!)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MacroTrackr.git
   cd MacroTrackr
   ```

2. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql`
   - Get your project URL and anon key

3. **Configure the app**
   - Open `MacroTrackr.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Set up environment variables:
     - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
     - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
     - `USDA_API_KEY`: Your USDA FoodData Central API key (optional)
   - These can be set in Xcode's build settings or through environment variables

4. **Build and run**
   - Select your target device or simulator
   - Build and run the project (‚åò+R)

### USDA Food Database Integration

The app uses the USDA FoodData Central API to provide a comprehensive ingredient database:

1. **Get USDA API Key** (Required for online features)
   - Register at [fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html)
   - Click "Get API Key" and create a free account
   - Copy your API key (it looks like: `DEMO_KEY` but with your actual key)
   
2. **Configure API Key in Xcode**
   - Open your project in Xcode
   - Select your target ‚Üí Build Settings
   - Search for "User-Defined"
   - Click the "+" button and add:
     - **Name**: `USDA_API_KEY`
     - **Value**: Your API key from step 1
   - Build and run - the app will now use the USDA database

**Features:**
- Downloads popular ingredients on first launch (requires API key)
- Stores ingredients locally for offline use
- Online search for specific foods via globe icon (requires API key)
- Automatic daily updates of ingredient database
- **Fallback**: Uses local ingredient database if API key is missing

**Note**: Without a USDA API key, the app will use the built-in fallback ingredients and OpenFoodFacts for barcode scanning.

### Supabase Setup

The app uses Supabase for backend services. See `supabase-config.md` for detailed setup instructions.
