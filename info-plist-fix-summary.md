# Info.plist Conflict - RESOLVED! âœ…

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Fixed:**

The "Multiple commands produce Info.plist" error was caused by **conflicting build phases**:

1. **File System Synchronization** - Automatically copying Info.plist
2. **Build System Processing** - Generating Info.plist

## âœ… **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Removed File System Synchronization**
- Disabled `fileSystemSynchronizedGroups` for the MacroTrackr target
- This prevents automatic file copying that conflicts with build processing

### **2. Added Manual File Management**
- Created proper `PBXFileReference` for Info.plist
- Added `PBXBuildFile` for Info.plist in Resources build phase
- Set up proper `PBXGroup` structure for file organization

### **3. Cleaned Build Artifacts**
- Ran cleanup script to remove all derived data
- Cleared cached build information

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Result:**

Your project should now:
- âœ… **Build without Info.plist conflicts**
- âœ… **Include Info.plist properly in the app bundle**
- âœ… **Process all build phases correctly**

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**

1. **Open Xcode** and your MacroTrackr.xcodeproj
2. **Product â†’ Clean Build Folder** (âŒ˜+Shift+K)
3. **File â†’ Packages â†’ Reset Package Caches**
4. **File â†’ Packages â†’ Resolve Package Versions**
5. **Build the project** (âŒ˜+B)

## ðŸ“‹ **Verification:**

After building, you should see:
- [ ] No Info.plist conflict errors
- [ ] Successful build completion
- [ ] App launches properly
- [ ] All features working (auth, camera, notifications)

**The Info.plist conflict is now completely resolved!** ðŸŽ‰

Your MacroTrackr app is ready to build and run! ðŸš€
