# MacroTrackr - Build Fixes Complete! ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ BUILD SUCCESSFUL - All compilation errors resolved

---

## üéØ Summary

All compilation errors in the MacroTrackr iOS app have been successfully fixed. The app now builds without errors and is ready for testing on the iOS Simulator.

---

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Friend Request Error** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Friend request sending failed with generic error message  
**Root Cause:** Missing validation and error handling  
**Solution:**
- Added checks for self-requests (can't send request to yourself)
- Added validation for existing friendships
- Added validation for pending requests
- Improved error messages with specific feedback
- Auto-accept if user already received request from target

**Files Modified:**
- `MacroTrackr/MacroTrackrApp.swift` (lines 440-514)

---

### 2. **Profile Picture Upload RLS Policy Violation** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** "new row violates row-level security policy" when uploading profile picture  
**Root Cause:** 
- No dedicated storage bucket for profile images
- Missing RLS policies for profile images
- Wrong bucket and path structure

**Solution:**
- Created new `profile-images` storage bucket in Supabase
- Added RLS policies allowing users to manage their own profile images
- Updated upload function to use `profile-images` bucket
- Images stored in user-specific folders: `{userId}/profile.jpg`

**Files Modified:**
- `MacroTrackr/MacroTrackrApp.swift` (uploadProfileImage function)
- `supabase-schema.sql` (added bucket and policies)

---

### 3. **Compilation Errors** ‚úÖ

#### A. Missing Imports
**Problem:** Various "Cannot find type" errors  
**Solution:** Added missing imports:
- `import Supabase` to `DailyView.swift`
- `import Combine` to `AddMealView.swift`
- `import WidgetKit` to `MacroTrackrApp.swift`

#### B. Syntax Errors
**Problem:** Consecutive statements error in `MacroTrackrApp.swift`  
**Solution:** Removed stray backtick after `.execute()` call

#### C. CameraManager Protocol Conformance
**Problem:** `CameraManager` didn't conform to `ObservableObject`  
**Solution:**
- Added `@Published var isSessionActive = false` property
- Implemented `AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate` properly
- Updated delegate methods to handle photo capture

#### D. ProfileView Privacy Settings
**Problem:** Type ambiguity in update call  
**Solution:**
- Used `AnyJSON.bool()` and `AnyJSON.string()` for proper typing
- Added missing `.execute()` call
- Implemented proper save/load functionality

#### E. Widget Data Sharing
**Problem:** `authManager` not in scope in `DataManager`  
**Solution:** Changed `updateWidgetData()` to accept `userId` parameter

#### F. UIScreen Deprecation
**Problem:** `UIScreen.main` deprecated in iOS 26.0  
**Solution:** Updated `CameraPreviewView` to use dynamic view bounds

## üöÄ Next Steps

### To Run the App:
```bash
# Option 1: Using Xcode
open MacroTrackr.xcodeproj
# Then press ‚åò+R to run

# Option 2: Using command line
xcodebuild -project MacroTrackr.xcodeproj \
  -scheme MacroTrackr \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  run
```

### Database Setup:

## üìä Supabase Free Plan Assessment

### Current Usage:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS ‚úÖ
- **Auth**: Built-in authentication ‚úÖ
- **Storage**: Two buckets (`meal-images`, `profile-images`) ‚úÖ
- **API Requests**: Standard CRUD operations ‚úÖ

### Free Plan Limits:
- 500 MB database space
- 1 GB bandwidth/month
- 5 GB storage (file uploads)
- 50,000 monthly active users
- Unlimited API requests

### Recommendation:
**The Supabase free plan is PERFECT for this application**, especially during development and early adoption. You can scale to the Pro plan ($25/month) when you reach these limits.

## üêõ Known Issues / Future Improvements

### Minor Issues:
1. Camera food scanning uses simulation - needs ML model integration
2. Widget requires App Group setup in Xcode project settings
3. Some async error handling could be improved

### Future Enhancements:
1. Implement real AI food recognition (Vision + CoreML)
2. Add offline mode with local Realm caching
3. Implement social feed for friends
4. Add meal recommendations based on goals
5. Export data functionality
6. Dark mode refinements
