# Webhooks & Cron Setup Guide 🔔

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Webhooks Enabled | ⏰ Cron Ready to Install  
**Code Changes:** ✅ Realtime listeners added

---

## ✅ Webhooks - Already Enabled!

### What You Did:
- ✅ Enabled Database Webhooks in Supabase dashboard

### What I Added to Code:
- ✅ Realtime subscription listeners
- ✅ Auto-reload when friend requests received
- ✅ Auto-reload when meals updated
- ✅ Proper cleanup on app close

### How It Works Now:

**Scenario 1: Friend Request Received**
```
Tester2 sends request → Supabase webhook fires → 
Your app listens → Auto-reloads friend requests → 
UI updates instantly (no refresh needed!)
```

**Scenario 2: Meal Added/Updated**
```
You add meal → Supabase webhook → 
App listens → Reloads today's meals → 
Widget updates → UI refreshes
```

---

## 🔄 Realtime Features Now Active:

### 1. Friend Request Notifications
**File:** `MacroTrackrApp.swift` (lines 871-901)

```swift
func subscribeToFriendRequests(userId: String)
```

**What it does:**
- Listens for new friend requests sent TO you
- Listens for updates to requests you SENT
- Auto-reloads friend requests list
- Updates UI instantly

**Test:**
1. Login as Tester1 in one simulator
2. Login as Tester2 in another simulator (or web)
3. Tester2 sends request to Tester1
4. **Tester1's app updates automatically!** ✅

---

### 2. Meal Updates
**File:** `MacroTrackrApp.swift` (lines 903-922)

```swift
func subscribeToMeals(userId: String)
```

**What it does:**
- Listens for new meals added
- Listens for meal edits/deletes
- Auto-reloads today's meals
- Updates widget data
- Refreshes UI

**Test:**
1. Add meal on device
2. Widget updates automatically
3. Stats refresh without manual reload

## ⏰ Cron Jobs - Should You Install?

### **YES! Install Cron** - Here's Why:

| Job | Benefit | Impact |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Daily Stats | Pre-calculated stats = faster queries | HIGH |
| Cleanup Old Data | Smaller database = better performance | MEDIUM |
| User Streaks | Track consecutive logging days | HIGH |
| Widget Refresh | Ensure widgets stay current | MEDIUM |

---

## 📋 How to Install Cron Jobs

### Step 1: Enable Cron Extension in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **Database** → **Extensions**
3. Search for **"pg_cron"**
4. Click **Enable**

---

### Step 2: Run the Cron SQL Script

I've created `supabase-cron-jobs.sql` for you with 4 useful cron jobs.

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy contents of `supabase-cron-jobs.sql`
4. Paste and click **Run**

**Option B: Via Terminal**
```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed:
supabase db push supabase-cron-jobs.sql
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Cron Jobs Are Running

**Check Active Jobs:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job;
```

**Check Job History:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details 
ORDER BY start_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### File: MacroTrackrApp.swift

**Added:**
```swift
// Properties (lines 313-315)
private var friendRequestsSubscription: Task<Void, Never>?
private var mealsSubscription: Task<Void, Never>?

// Methods (lines 870-927)
func subscribeToFriendRequests(userId: String)
func subscribeToMeals(userId: String)
func unsubscribeFromRealtime()

// Activation (lines 1028-1036)
.onAppear { 
    dataManager.subscribeToFriendRequests(userId: userId)

    dataManager.unsubscribeFromRealtime()
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test Realtime Updates:

### Test 1: Friend Request Realtime
**Setup:** Two devices/simulators

1. **Device A:** Login as Tester1, go to Friends tab
2. **Device B:** Login as Tester2, send request to Tester1
3. **Expected:** Device A's friend requests update automatically!

---

### Test 2: Meal Updates Realtime
**Setup:** Same device, use widget

1. Open app, note current macros
2. Add a meal
3. **Expected:** 
   - Today's meals list updates immediately
   - Widget refreshes automatically
   - No manual refresh needed

---

## 📊 What's Different Now:
