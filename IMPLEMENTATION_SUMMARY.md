1. **Run the SQL script** (`fix-rls-policies.sql`)
2. **Test all features** using the testing checklist above
3. **Report any remaining issues** for further fixes
4. **Consider production deployment** once all tests pass

**üéâ The app should now be significantly more functional and user-friendly!**
