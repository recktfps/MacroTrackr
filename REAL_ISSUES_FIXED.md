5. **Check Console:** Should see detailed upload logs

### Test 2: Friend Requests ‚úÖ
1. **Open App** ‚Üí Profile Tab ‚Üí Friends
2. **Tap "Add Friend"**
3. **Enter Display Name** (e.g., "TestUser")

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup Required

**IMPORTANT:** You must run the database fix script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

3. **Copy and paste** the contents of `fix_database_issues.sql`
4. **Run the script** to ensure buckets and policies are correct

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Create/configure `profile-images` bucket

- ‚úÖ Set up proper RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Verify friend request triggers
- ‚úÖ Check all required tables exist
