# Fix Realm Linking Conflict

## Problem
You're getting this error:
```
Swift package target 'Realm' is linked as a static library by 'MacroTrackr' and 'Realm', but cannot be built dynamically because there is a package product with the same name.
```

## ✅ Solution Applied
I've already fixed the project file by removing the duplicate Realm package. Here's what was changed:

### What I Fixed:
1. **Removed duplicate Realm package** from project dependencies
2. **Kept only RealmSwift** (which includes everything you need)
3. **Cleaned up all references** to the separate Realm package

## 🔧 Manual Steps (if needed)

If you still get the error, follow these steps in Xcode:

### Method 1: Remove Package in Xcode
1. **Open Xcode** and open your `MacroTrackr.xcodeproj`
2. **Select your project** in the navigator (blue icon)
3. **Go to "Package Dependencies"** tab
4. **Find Realm package** in the list
5. **Select it and click the "-" button** to remove it
6. **Keep only RealmSwift** package

### Method 2: Reset Package Cache
1. In Xcode, go to **File → Packages → Reset Package Caches**
2. Then go to **File → Packages → Resolve Package Versions**
3. **Clean Build Folder** (⌘+Shift+K)
4. **Build again** (⌘+B)

### Method 3: Clean Project
1. **Product → Clean Build Folder** (⌘+Shift+K)
2. **Close Xcode completely**
3. **Delete derived data**: 
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MacroTrackr-*
   ```
4. **Reopen Xcode** and build again

## 📋 What You Should Have

### Correct Package Dependencies:
- ✅ **Supabase** (Auth, Functions, PostgREST, Realtime, Storage)
- ✅ **Kingfisher** (Image loading)
- ✅ **RealmSwift** (Local database - includes Realm automatically)

### What Was Removed:
- ❌ **Separate Realm package** (caused the conflict)

## 🎯 Why This Happened

- **RealmSwift** automatically includes the **Realm** library
- Having both packages created a **naming conflict**
- Xcode couldn't decide which one to use
- The solution is to use **only RealmSwift**

## ✅ Verification

After the fix, your project should:
1. **Build successfully** without linking errors
2. **Have all Realm functionality** (RealmSwift includes everything)
3. **Work exactly the same** as before

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Try building** your project now
2. **If it still fails**, follow the manual steps above
3. **Test Realm functionality** to ensure everything works
4. **Let me know** if you need further assistance

The fix I applied should resolve the issue, but if you encounter any problems, the manual steps above will definitely fix it!
